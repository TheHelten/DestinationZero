1: About "Destination Zero"
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

What is Destination Zero? A weapons and monsters mod. People will claim there are R667 rips.
The only thing ripped from R667 what-so-ever is imagery, and potential SFX. Otherwise, weapon code
and monster code is entirely mine. I don't know if there's a piece in here that belongs to anyone
else, but if there is, please message me and there will be credit listed or there can be an arrangement
made to have the piece removed from the mod.

Though there may be the factor that not everything is mine, so if you travel unto the second page
you'll notice what ISN'T mine (though ALOT of it is mine anyhow, and no coding is anyone elses.)

5: Thank You's
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

You all are very awesome (obv. excluding people I hate... [JUST KIDDING{?}]) Simple ending piece,
saying "Thank You" to all the players of this WAD (If it has any!)

Mega Thanks to Big-Huge games and Ensemblem Studios for the awesome Cannon-firing sound for the Green-Abus!

Also thanking Blizzard Entertainment and IdSoftware, Blizzard for some of the master-piece's of sound
effects, and IdSoftware for creating Doom and Doom3, which were sources of sounds and sometimes remakes.

Especially thanking Skulltag for the days of fun it gave, and now Zandronum
and it's developers/creators/moderators/administraitors, or whatever.

Get out there and murder some hellspawn, and remember to thank these folks!!!

...And maybe me, too...?
